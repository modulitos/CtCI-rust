# Cracking the Coding Interview with Rust

This repository contains code for my learnings on Rust while solving some programming problems. The problems are based on the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. You can find the existing solutions [here](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition).

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you'll need an up-to-date version of Rust. The recommended way of
installing Rust is [using a tool called rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```ShellSession
$ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Once you have Rust installed, you can build and run the tests.

### Running the Code

```ShellSession
$ cargo build
$ cargo test
```

You can run the tests for a specific library like so:

```ShellSession
$ cargo test --lib fifth
```
